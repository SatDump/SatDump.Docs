Building on Windows
===================

**These instructions and scripts assume you will be using Microsoft
Visual Studio 2022**. Building SatDump on Windows requires Microsoft
Visual Studio 2019 or greater. If you are using another version of
Visual Studio, update ``windows\Build.ps1`` as necessary.

**On install, set Visual Studio up for use with:**

* Desktop development with C++
* Python Development Support (for building dependencies)

* Within Visual Studio, go to Tools > Python > Python Environments. Change the "Overview" dropdown to "Packages (PyPI)"
  and install mako (for building dependencies)

Automated PowerShell Build Instructions
---------------------------------------

Using the automated PowerShell build scripts is the easiest way to build
SatDump on Windows.

1. Open “Developer PowerShell for VS 2022” from the start Menu

   .. figure:: https://github.com/JVital2013/goestools-win/assets/24253715/ef7af001-c45e-4ee7-88e6-d9bb33d6a5fe

2. cd to a directory where you want to build SatDump

3. Run the following commands, one at a time

.. code-block:: powershell

   powershell
   git clone https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump
   cd SatDump
   .\windows\Configure-vcpkg.ps1 # Downloads vcpkg and configures it to build SatDump.
                                 # This may take a while! 
   .\windows\Build-SatDump.ps1   # Builds SatDump 
   .\windows\Finish-Release.ps1  # Copies all necessary files into the Release folder

Your build SatDump will be in the ``build\Release`` folder of the
SatDump repo.

Building in Visual Studio for Debugging
---------------------------------------

Compiling in Visual Studio for Debugging is for advanced users who
aren’t afriad to get their hands dirty!

1.  Open “Developer PowerShell for VS 2022” from the start Menu

    .. figure:: https://github.com/JVital2013/goestools-win/assets/24253715/ef7af001-c45e-4ee7-88e6-d9bb33d6a5fe
       

2.  cd to a directory where you want to build SatDump

3.  Run the following commands, one at a time

   .. code-block:: powershell

      powershell
      git clone https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump
      cd SatDump
      .\windows\Configure-vcpkg.ps1 # Downloads vcpkg and configures it to build SatDump.
                                    # This may take a while! 

4.  Keeping the developer console open in the background, open Microsoft
    Visual Studio. On the launch screen, select “Open a local folder”,
    and select your cloned SatDump repo.

    .. figure:: https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump/assets/24253715/22f2258d-0cc4-4b6e-9c5c-5e0dd4fb8b53
       

5.  Once the project opens, select “Open CMake Settings Editor”

    .. figure:: https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump/assets/24253715/026d6ea5-9b6d-4560-899b-175bd8f13eef
       

6.  In CMake Settings, change the following items:

    -  **CMake toolchain file:** set this to
       ``<full path of your satdump repo>\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake``
    -  **CMake valiables and cache:** check “BUILD_MSVC”
    -  **CMake Generator (under “show advanced settings”):** set this
       to ``Visual Studio 17 2022 Win64``

7.  Press Ctrl+S to save the CMake Settings. You will usually get an
    error right away - this is normal. Either way, click Project >
    Delete Cache and Reconfigure. Confirm the prompt and let cmake
    rebuild its cache

    .. figure:: https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump/assets/24253715/9205663f-011f-4c52-a31d-f60795fa3822
       

8.  Once cmake finishes, click Build > Build All. Go get come coffee
    because this takes several minutes

    .. figure:: https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump/assets/24253715/3f0a38a1-3e98-41b7-bddb-5aa6c376aec4
       

9.  Once you get the “Build all succeded” message, go back to your
    developer terminal (it’s still open, right?) and run
    ``.\windows\Finish-Debug.ps1``. This will copy all necessary DLL
    files into the debug folder.

10. That’s it, you’re ready to debug! To make any changes to the code
    and build again, just repeat steps 8 and 9 before launching the
    debugger. **Step 9 is important, because it copies the plugin DLLs
    into the right spot for SatDump to load them!**

Debugging SatDump UI
--------------------

Once you built SatDump for debugging in Windows, using the debugger is
the same as it is with any other Visual Studio project.

1. At the top, set the startup item to “satdump-ui.exe” (not the
   installed one!)

   .. figure:: https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump/assets/24253715/e811a074-3f3c-4e2b-8bf9-7600a17b577b
      

2. Click the green start icon to start debugging SatDump-UI. Breakpoints
   and other tested debugger functionality works as expected

   .. figure:: https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump/assets/24253715/77ae1ddd-6507-4477-968f-b488e76f366b
      

Debugging SatDump CLI
---------------------

Debugging the CLI version is similar to the UI, but you need to provide
command line arguments

1. At the top, change the startup item to “satdump.exe”

   .. figure:: https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump/assets/24253715/92ff0872-6aec-476f-889c-de2468d66b82
      

2. Go to Debug > Debug and Launch setting for SatDump

   .. figure:: https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump/assets/24253715/c173425c-4cb5-4cbd-8020-ee1342dfffaa
      

3. Add the satdump launch arguments in the form of an array. If you
   compose the argument list elsewhere and copy/paste it here, it will
   turn it into an array for you. You may need to clean it up, though

   .. figure:: https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump/assets/24253715/0ae0ee59-bc0b-48da-80d5-de2dd3e0757a
      

4. Click the green start icon to start debugging SatDump.
