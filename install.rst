Installation
================


Windows

    Installer
    Portable

    Our builds are made with Visual Studio 2019 for x64, so the appropriate Visual C++ Runtime will be required (though, likely to be already installed). You can get it here in case you run into errors.

macOS

    Intel DMG

    This DMG file is compatible with Apple Silicon (M1/M2 Macs), but for performance reasons it is strongly recommended to compile SatDump yourself on your Apple Silicon Mac.

Linux

    Ubuntu 22.04 and later

    For Linux it is recommended to compile SatDump yourself on your machine. This deb file is provided for your convenience.

Android

    Android 9 and later APK

    While pretty much all features perfectly function on Android, there may be some limitations (including hardware limitations depending on the device in use) in some places. For example, not all SDR radios can be used. Currently, only the RTL-SDR, Airspy, Airspy HF, LimeSDR Mini and HackRF are supported on Android.

Nightly

The nightly versions are automatically built when the source code is updated. You can download them to try out new features or to check if a bug has been already resolved.

Alternatively, you can compile SatDump yourself.
