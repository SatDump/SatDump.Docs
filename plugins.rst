Plugin List
===========

Since SatDump 1.0.0, most if not all code that is not common between
many satellites or features is not in the main library anymore, but
instead in plugins. Those plugins are entirely optional, and there is no
requirement anymore to build the entire codebase.

By default ``-DPLUGINS_ALL=ON`` is set in CMake, but setting it to
``OFF`` will allow selecting what you wish to build. The syntax to
enable a specific plugin is ``-DPLUGIN_NAME=ON``.

The list provided belows aims at being a “quick-look” of what every
plugin covers to help unfamiliar users decide on what they actually
need.

The string in paranthesis after each plugin is the argument to be passed
to CMake.

Satellite support

Elektro/Arktika (PLUGIN_ELEKTRO_ARKTIKA)
----------------------------------------

This plugin cover the ELEKTRO and ARKTIKA Russian weather satellites,
both being very similar.

Supported downlinks : - X-Band RDAS from both - ELEKTRO-L LRIT -
ELEKTRO-L HRIT - Low-Rate radiation payload downlink

----------------

This covers NASA’s Earth Observation System. - Aqua (Direct Broadcast) -

FengYun-2 (PLUGIN_FY2)
----------------------

Covers the first generation of FengYun GEO sats. Only S-VISSR is
supported.

FengYun-3 (PLUGIN_FY3)
----------------------

Supports all FengYun-3 satellites : - FengYun-A/B/C AHRPT on L-Band -
FengYun-A/B/C MPT on X-Band - FengYun-A/B X-Band dumps (DPT) -
FengYun-D/E X-Band AHRPT

GK-2A (PLUGIN_GK2A)
-------------------

Supported downlinks : - GK-2A LRIT - GK-2A HRIT

GOES (PLUGIN_GOES)
------------------

This covers the NOAA GOES weather satellites : - GOES-N GVAR - GOES-R
HRIT - GOES-R CDA - GOES-R GRB

Himawari (PLUGIN_HIMAWARI)

Supports the Jason-3 Altimetry mission on S-Band.

JPSS (PLUGIN_JPSS)
------------------

Provides support for the JPSS satellite mission : - Suomi NPP and JPSS-1
HRD - JPSS-2/3/4 HRD

Meteor (PLUGIN_METEOR)
----------------------

Covers the russian METEOR missions : - L-Band AHRPT - LRPT on VHF

NOAA/MetOp (PLUGIN_NOAA_METOP)
------------------------------

This covers the POES missions, including the first generation MetOps and
NOAA POES, carrying very similar instruments.

Support downlinks : - NOAA DSB - NOAA HRPT - NOAA GAC - MetOp AHRPT -
MetOp X-Band dumps

OceanSat (PLUGIN_OCEANSAT)
--------------------------

Provides support for the OceanSat Indian satellite missions. -
OceanSat-2 Direct Broadcast

Others (PLUGIN_OTHERS)
----------------------

| This plugin acts as a temporary place before some satellites are moved
  into their own plugin.
| Currently, this includes : - Angels - CloudSat - Coriolis - Saral

Proba (PLUGIN_PROBA)
--------------------

Covers the ESA Project for OnBoard Autonomy series of satellites : -
Proba-1 - Proba-2 - Proba-V

SpaceX (PLUGIN_SPACEX)
----------------------

This contains old support for the SpaceX Falcon-9 and StarShip telemetry
downlinks. This is currently not updated as SpaceX has made the decision
to encrypt the telemetry since then, but the code is kept to allow
processing older data and in the eventuallity encryption is turned off
in the future.

Scripting (PLUGIN_SCRIPTING)
----------------------------

This allows Lua :doc:`scripting`, for example to archive data when the processing is finished.
